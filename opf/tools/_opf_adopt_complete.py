"""OPF adoption completion evaluator, slice 1: the read-only deterministic checks 1 to 4 and 6 (OPF-SPEC 1.3.0).

Spec sections implemented: 14.1 (the clean-start completion-check roster: checks 1 authority and freshness,
2 discovery accounting, 3 preservation and restore, 4 operational readiness and 6 retirement readiness; a
completion-check failure or cannot-evaluate reports incomplete and retires nothing), 14.1's homes-1 clause
(the completion checks re-read inventories and payload digests themselves, because C-EVIDENCE-ENUM is
inactive until homes 2) and 4.2 (C-EVIDENCE-ENUM MUST NOT run or read anything on homes 1; the section 14.1
completion checks carry the evidence digest verification). Check 5 (wiring: the enforcement-pack probes) is
NOT evaluated here: its probes run processes and land in a later slice, so the roster this module reports is
never green on its own (roster_green requires all six checks VALID).

Read-only: every live read is contained and no-follow through the apply shell's own reader
(_opf_adopt_apply._read_live, single-linked regular files only), nothing is written to the live tree, and no
process is spawned. The one write is check 3's restore exercise, which copies archived bytes into a private
TemporaryDirectory scratch and digest-verifies the copy there; it never restores over the live tree.

Inputs: the product root, the adoption run id, the adopter-held planning inventory bytes
(`opf.adoption.planning-inventory/v1`, the bytes the plan's inventory_digest seals; apply persists the plan
and approval in the run's bundle, not the planning inventory), and a doctor callable (product_root to the
_opf_check StoreValidation shape: status, findings, cannot_evaluate). The doctor's git observations are a
process-spawning gather, so the caller supplies the run (store_doctor builds one from caller-supplied inert
observations); with no doctor, check 4 is CANNOT-EVALUATE, never a pass.

Outcome model (single-sourced from _opf_store): each check is VALID (green), INVALID (red, with findings) or
CANNOT-EVALUATE (an input it cannot read or parse, never a pass). An absent required artefact (no approval,
no receipt, an absent preimage or live file) is a finding; an unreadable or malformed one is
CANNOT-EVALUATE. A plan that does not re-prove (frozen_plan) leaves every check CANNOT-EVALUATE.

Check ownership, so one mutation flips one check (the canonical single-mutation flips of the self-test):
  1 authority-freshness: the frozen plan re-proves and names this run, the bundle's approval binds it
    (approval_findings), the receipt core validates and binds the run, product, plan and inventory digests,
    store root, release manifest and the approval itself, each receipt file row names a plan source with its
    disposition and before_digest, and the live preimages of the sources the plan leaves live and no other
    check owns (keep, and non-occupying migrate) still equal their plan digests. The retire-disposed live
    files are check 6's, so an edited retire source flips check 6 only.
  2 discovery-accounting: the planning inventory re-seals to the plan's inventory_digest; every candidate,
    empty directory and walked file under `.working/` has a plan disposition or lies under a recorded
    exclusion (the store control area counts as one, spec 14.2); every plan source is an observed file whose
    digest equals its plan digest.
  3 preservation-restore: the run's evidence bundle verifies from disk (_opf_adopt_apply.verify_bundle, the
    homes-1 evidence digest verification: every inventory and every payload it lists); every preserved
    source (retire, migrate and occupying, spec 14.2) sits at its run archive path, digest-matched and
    claimed by the bundle inventory; and the restore exercise reproduces each preserved file's bytes in
    scratch.
  4 operational-readiness: the store resolves to the planned identity (an absent store is a finding, so a
    de-adopted repository cannot pass as NOT-APPLICABLE); every CI enforcement member is live at its plan
    digest and carries the store-presence assertion (`--require-store`); every planned view destination
    holds its planned bytes, or the bytes of the plan-enumerated occupying source at that destination (the
    validated prospective poststate: an accounted occupancy is not a deadlock); every consumer repointing
    holds its planned new bytes; and the doctor is VALID once its C-VIEW-DRIFT findings at accounted
    destinations are set aside. Any other drift fails the check.
  6 retirement-readiness: each retire-disposed source that occupied no managed destination is present live
    with its plan digest; each archived occupying source still equals its plan digest in the archive.

DISCLOSED RESIDUALS: the receipt core schema requires a null after_digest for retire and move rows, which
TOML cannot spell, so check 1 compares only the receipt rows present and cannot require one row per source;
check 2 trusts the planning inventory the caller supplies once it re-seals to the plan's bound digest;
check 4's doctor verdict is only as complete as the caller's observations; the CI assertion is a byte
presence test on the planned CI member, not a run of CI.

Offline, stdlib only, fail-closed. It lives under `opf/tools/` and imports ONLY sibling `opf/tools/`
modules, so the standalone-closure property holds.

Exit convention (the repo's gates and the sibling OPF units): 0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 cannot-evaluate.
