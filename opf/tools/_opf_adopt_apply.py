"""OPF adoption apply engine, slice 1: the apply SHELL with ZERO executable operations (OPF-SPEC 1.3.0).

This slice (the clean-start adoption track's first apply unit) supplies the engine SKELETON only, shaped
by spec 1.3.0 sections 4.2, 5.7 and 14: run identity; the evidence-bundle, archive and Move homes, all
derived from the `_opf_store` homes constructors (never re-spelled here); the `opf.evidence.inventory/v1`
inventory DERIVED from the run's own transaction op list and published in that SAME transaction as the
retained bytes it lists (spec 4.2), a base `inventory.toml` then one `inventory-<phase>.toml` per later
phase, never rewritten; the homes-1 bundle verification the completion checks carry themselves while
C-EVIDENCE-ENUM is inactive (spec 14.1), which RE-READS the inventories and payload digests from disk;
the preserve-first composition of spec 14.2; live re-observation of every operand; one journaled
transaction per (run, phase), reconcile-first; and a dispatch table keyed by the closed twelve-op
ADOPT_OPS vocabulary in which EVERY op returns a refusing not-yet-executable verdict. No operation
executes: the file ops, init-store composition, trust verification, approval capture, hook activation,
rendering, receipt writing, the completion checks, retirement, and the CLI verb remain later slices.
Outside its own self-test fixtures this module is dead code until those slices land.

Preserve-first (spec 14.2), enforced over the composed op list BEFORE any transaction opens: a live file
is removed, OR OVERWRITTEN BY A `write` (which destroys the live bytes exactly as a removal does), ONLY
as the second half of a pair whose first half, earlier in the SAME transaction, creates its byte-identical
archive copy at `.working/archive/adoption/<run-id>/<source-path>`. The copy's create op carries the plan
digest as its content digest, which the journal verifies against the staged bytes, RE-READS from the
written destination and digest-verifies again (a spec 14.2 verification checkpoint), and fsyncs (file and
parent) before the next op runs, and the removal or write carries the same digest and mode as a
`source-poststate` pin, which the journal verifies at preimage capture under its lock. So the copy is
verified on disk and durably committed before the source is destroyed, never reversed and never split
across transactions, and a pre-commit abort (the journal's reverse-order rollback) restores the source
from its digest-checked preimage, RE-READS and digest-verifies the restored live bytes, and only then
discards the copy or reports a prestate (the rollback-side checkpoint). A source whose live bytes no
longer match its plan digest is drifted and is never archived or removed. A non-occupying source takes
only its retirement preimage at apply and stays frozen in place (its removal waits for the green
completion check, a later slice). An `rmdir` may target ONLY a directory this same transaction created; a
pre-existing live directory is never removed by this shell. The store control roots
(`_opf_store.STORE_ROOT_CONTROL_DIRS`: `.git/` and `.aiqt/`, the adoption journal's own tree included) are
never apply operands of ANY kind. The adoption archive and every evidence bundle are immutable: an op may
only create beneath this run's own archive, this run's own bundle, or the Move root, never write, remove,
or rmdir anything under `.working/archive/` or `.working/imported/`, and never create in another run's
home.

The adoption journal root is `.aiqt/adopt/journal` at the PRODUCT root: the homes-1 legacy journal family
of `.aiqt/record/journal` and `.aiqt/import/journal`. It is anchored there, never under the store, because
recovery of an interrupted apply MUST resolve from the apply journal alone and MUST NOT require the live
tree to resolve as a store (spec 14.2): an apply that archived and removed an occupying manifest leaves no
store to resolve. reconcile() therefore never resolves the store. Homes 2 relocates transaction records
under `.working/journals/adoption/` and forbids OPF state under `.aiqt/` (spec 4.2, 14.2); homes 2 is not
activated in this build (SUPPORTED_HOMES = 1).

Journal discipline (reconcile-first, the `opf record` step-1 posture): every transaction inspects the
adoption journal FIRST and REFUSES on a held lock (never seized) or any open (INTENT-without-terminal)
transaction. Recovery is the EXPLICIT reconcile() entry: it rolls an open transaction forward when every
poststate already verifies, else back from its durable preimages (`_journal.recover`), under the journal's
own lock, breaking a confirmed-dead owner's lock only through `_journal.reconcile_and_claim_stale`; the
interrupted run stays refused. A transaction is named by its run (base) or run.phase, so one run has at
most one base transaction and one per phase; a second attempt refuses before it opens, and changing
approved work takes a fresh plan with its own run id (spec 14.1).

Single-writer lease (spec 5.7): this slice carries NO lease join, so a transaction REFUSES, before writing
anything, when the product root resolves a store (RESOLVED) or when a pointer names a store outside the
product root, and EVERY other store posture that cannot be evaluated (a malformed or unreadable pointer,
multiple machine stores, an undiscoverable root) refuses too (spec 14.2: an unreadable declaration or
detected input fails closed). Only the two first-adoption states adoption exists for are admitted:
NOT-ADOPTED, and a present `.working/` at the DEFAULT location carrying no valid manifest, re-proved by a
fresh discovery. A first adoption has no store and so no lease home; the pre-store single-writer control is
the coupled-init substrate's operation lock, which joins with the init-store slice. Disclosed residuals of
this slice, none of them a relaxation: bundle MEMBERSHIP (an off-inventory file inside a bundle) is not
reconciled here, only listed payloads; containment registration of the archive, Move and evidence homes on
homes 1 is part of the 1.3.0 activation, not this slice; investigation does not read this journal (the
planner's ancestry disclosure lists durable OPF history outside .working, and `.aiqt/adopt/journal` is one
more such home), so the stage driver's plan stage must refuse over a non-clean adoption journal through
journal_clean_or_refuse; the shipped `retire-file` vocabulary row is a single `remove`, while spec 1.3.0
preserves the retirement preimage at apply and removes only after the green check, a vocabulary split for
the op slices; interruption is exercised in-process through the journal's kill-point seam, and
subprocess kill-injection arrives with the first executable operations.

Outcome model: single-sourced from `_opf_store` exactly as the sibling `_opf_adopt` does; the inventory
grading is the doctor's own shared validator (`_opf_check._evidence_rows`), so a malformed inventory or a
path claimed twice is CANNOT-EVALUATE and the legacy ingest format is the named `legacy-ingest-inventory`
finding (spec 4.2). Filesystem entry points raise `AdoptApplyError` (a fail-closed refusal, exit 2).

Offline, stdlib only, fail-closed. It lives under `opf/tools/` and imports ONLY sibling `opf/tools/`
modules, so the standalone-closure property holds.

Exit convention (the repo's gates and the sibling OPF units): 0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 cannot-evaluate.

    # between the chmod and the revert-protected reopen) now reaches the revert, and a fault AT
    # the post-checkpoint prestate-mode install, BEFORE its fchmod takes effect, DELIBERATELY
    # leaves the grant behind a NAMED JournalError, the next reconcile finishing directly through
    # the still-writable file. Round-5 addition: a fault at the durability fsync AFTER that fchmod
    # took effect leaves the exact prestate mode with NO grant, behind a JournalError naming that
