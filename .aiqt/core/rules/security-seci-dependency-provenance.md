# Trusted, pinned dependency provenance

Dependencies, tools, external servers, and any model or artefact file that executes on load come from trusted
sources with pinned provenance. A file that runs code when loaded is scanned before use, and none is
introduced on the strength of its name or popularity alone. Before relying on a tool, MCP server,
connector, or external server, the active surface is reconciled against the approved pinned inventory; an
unrecognized, shadow, changed, or unpinned entry is treated as unavailable until it is reviewed and
authorized.
