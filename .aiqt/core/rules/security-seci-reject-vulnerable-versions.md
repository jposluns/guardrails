# Reject known-vulnerable dependency versions

Before a dependency is added or upgraded, the exact resolved version is checked against current
authoritative vulnerability advisories, and a version with a known exploitable vulnerability is rejected.
Authentic provenance does not make a version safe; a legitimate, correctly named package can still resolve
to an artefact that is unsafe to ship.
