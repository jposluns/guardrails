# Observe before asserting behaviour

Do not assert what a system shows, renders, prints, outputs, or does in its live state unless you observed
that behaviour directly. Reading a configuration, a setting, or source tells you what a system is configured
to do, not what it actually produces: precedence, environment, inputs, and runtime state sit between the
configuration and the result. This differs from reading a file for its static contents, where the reading is
itself the observation; here the observation is the rendered output. A claim that a system is launch-ready,
live, or working is such a behavioural claim: it rests on having exercised the relevant runtime path and
observed the expected result, not on a static check that the configuration or registration looks correct.
Either observe the behaviour and quote what you saw, or state the claim as an inference, naming the
configuration it rests on and the observation that would confirm it. The same holds for a status a document,
test, or record asserts about the live system: bind a machine-checkable status to a probe that exercises the
system, or generate it from an observation, so it cannot silently drift; hand-written prose asserting such a
status, free to diverge from what the system now does, does not belong in the record as settled fact. A
confident assertion of unobserved behaviour is not made.
