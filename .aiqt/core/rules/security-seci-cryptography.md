# Sound cryptography

Cryptography uses current, approved algorithms and correct parameters, with no weak, deprecated, or
home-grown schemes. Data is protected in transit and at rest to the strength its sensitivity requires.
Protection in transit is never defeated by disabling its verification: certificate and hostname validation
stay on, and code never disables TLS peer verification or accepts a self-signed or mismatched certificate
to work around a connection error.
