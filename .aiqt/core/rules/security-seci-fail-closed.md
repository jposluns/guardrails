# Fail closed in security-relevant paths

An exception or error in an authentication, authorization, validation, or cryptographic check leaves the
system in the deny or otherwise safe state. A failed, unavailable, or unreadable check is treated as not
passed, never as a default-allow.

Code that such a check loads can exit with any status, fault outside any handler (error formatting, cleanup,
background work, or shutdown), or replace the check's reporting machinery. Run in a child process, such code
yields a passing verdict only with a zero exit, a complete structured result written after the child's
cleanup, and no fault on its error stream, one that unreviewed or unpinned code cannot redirect or silence.
In process, each channel is covered, unreachable, or disclosed under the gate-discipline rule, a
fault-to-pass channel never merely disclosed; such review and pinning exempt from this only the channel by
which loaded code replaces that machinery.
