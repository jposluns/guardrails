# Validation is a gate on apply

There is no trusted-worker fast path: every candidate change is validated before it lands, no matter its
source. Trust is never a substitute for the gate. A caller that can tell, from what it already holds,
that a callee will refuse an input withholds the dispatch and reports the refusal; a check ahead of an
expensive apply meets guard-input-soundness (grdinp).
