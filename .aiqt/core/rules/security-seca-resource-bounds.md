# Bounded consumption and safe failure

Tool-call depth and recursion, token and cost budgets, and request rate are bounded, and the assistant
fails safe when a bound is reached rather than continuing unchecked. Loops that call tools or spawn work
carry a limit and a timeout, so a manipulated or runaway agent cannot exhaust resources, run up cost, or
cascade a failure across a system. Repeated failure of a downstream dependency suppresses further calls
to it, a circuit breaker or an equivalent backoff that stops while failure persists and probes before
full traffic resumes, so a degraded component is relieved rather than amplified into a wider outage.
