# Propose a guardrail when an error reveals a gap

When an error or near-miss traces back to no rule existing that would have prevented it, propose a new
guardrail as a follow-on once the immediate defect is fixed, drafted in the same taxonomy and frontmatter
shape as the rest of the corpus. The proposal is a candidate like any other, landing only through the
normal apply gate.
