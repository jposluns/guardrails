"""opf: the DevProcess (OPF) reference-tooling dispatcher (OPF core-tooling, skeleton from U1).

  opf.py --self-test                run every registered OPF helper self-test (the CI leg)
  opf.py <verb> [--root DIR] ...    a store verb (default --root: the cwd product repository root)

This is the SKELETON dispatcher the OPF core-tooling units grow into. U1 lands it with the store-side
helper self-test wired in; the store verbs (`render`, `import`, `doctor`, and the rest of the spec's
command vocabulary) are recognized names that report NOT-YET-IMPLEMENTED and fail closed (exit 2) until
their unit lands, so a stub can never read as a passing operation.

Adopter-rooted, like doctor.py/migrate.py/conformance.py: an OPF verb operates on a PRODUCT repository
root named by --root (default: the cwd), never on this pack's own tree via `_gen_common.repo_root()`.
The pack is not a DevProcess adopter, so a live `opf.py <verb> --root .` here reports NOT APPLICABLE
once the verbs land; the assurance rides the `--self-test` leg over synthetic stores (spec-honest,
mirroring the crosswalk/doctor/migrate legs in run_all_checks.sh).

Deliberately NOT named tools/gen_*.py: the generated-source registry (gen_gensrc.py) discovers gen_*.py
and validates fixed repo-relative targets, but OPF renders into an adopter --root with no fixed
repo-relative target, so this family gates as self-tests instead (the U1 build-plan section 5 rule).

Launched isolated (-I -B) per the Python-launcher-isolation gate; sibling helpers are imported through
the sys.path insert idiom the repo's tools share.
