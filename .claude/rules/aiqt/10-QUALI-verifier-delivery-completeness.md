# A degraded verifier delivery is not a verdict

A verifier's output counts as a verdict only when the verifier actually delivered one. Completeness is
judged by a single criterion: the delivery carries the positive evidence of a finished verdict that the
verification agreed on in advance, whether that agreed evidence is a completion marker the verifier emits,
the explicit verdict the verification asked for, or both. A delivery that lacks that agreed evidence, or
that is truncated, empty, or errored, is treated as no verdict, never as a pass, a vote, or a finding-free
result.
A capture piped through a truncating sink is a degraded delivery, not a verdict, even when its retained
prefix appears complete.
Completeness is never inferred from the length or volume of the output or from the mere absence of
a reported problem, because a run cut off before it reached its verdict is indistinguishable from a clean
one when judged by silence or size. A delivery that fails this test is re-dispatched and contributes
nothing; it does not by itself justify reducing the verifier panel, since one failed delivery is not
evidence that a verifier family is unavailable. A required family is dropped from the panel only when it
is genuinely unreachable, on the terms the verifier-diversity rule sets, and that reduction is recorded
and re-run when the family returns.
