# Disclose a guard's residual coverage

A best-effort guard that cannot cover its whole input space does not present itself as complete. Where the
domain is unbounded or evadable, an open command grammar, a matcher that option-insertion or wrapping can
slip past, or a denylist over an effectively infinite space, the guard states the residual it does not catch
rather than implying it catches everything. A coverage boundary named where the guard is defined is
reviewable; a boundary left implicit reads as a guarantee the guard cannot honour. The disclosure is part of
the guard, not a footnote discovered after it fails.
